*************** APPLICATIONS **************

[1] Electrophysiological assessment of plant status outside a Faraday cage using supervised machine learning
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-53675-4
Methods: PCA (visualization), GradientBoostingTrees, LogisticRegression

[2] Principal component analysis of dietary and lifestyle patterns in relation to risk of subtypes of esophageal and gastric cancer
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3109225/
Methods: PCA (pattern finding)

[3] https://github.com/huggingface/text-clustering ,
An interesting repo following the pipeline text_embeddings -> UMAP & Clustering, using large language models as well (chatGPT) for data analysis. It showcases a text-analysis pipeline with UMAP. A useful exercise to level up the python skills is going through the code in the repo.
Methods: Natural Language Processing (not done in course), large language models (not done in course), UMAP, Clustering

[4] Raptor: Recursive Abstractive Processing for Tree-Organized Retrieval 
https://arxiv.org/html/2401.18059v1
Methods: Natural Language Processing (not done in course), UMAP, GaussianMixtures
Note: this is a mixture of theory and application.


*************** THEORY READINGS **************

[1] Explaining individual predictions when features are dependent: More accurate approximations to Shapley values, 
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370221000539
SHAP tutorial: https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overviews.html
Methods: theory of interpretable machine learning (cited breafly during the course). The article is interesting for the overview at the beginning about shapley values.

[2] A Random Forest Guided Tour,
https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05741
Methods: random forests.

[3] Biplots in practice, https://www.fbbva.es/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dat/DE_2010_biplots_in_practice.pdf
Methods: PCA, and in particular how to interpret biplots.


*************** SELECTED COMMENTS TO PRESENTATIONS AND OFF COURSE TOPICS **************

[1] A couple of presentations worked with time series.
In this context one possibility, instead of using the raw signal one can try to perform feature extraction before using the features in a model. A couple of packages:
TSFRESH: https://tsfresh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ 
PYCATCH22: https://github.com/DynamicsAndNeuralSystems/pycatch22
, and references therein.
Here as well some comments about general possibilities in classical time series forecasting:

[2] For same presentations, it would be useful to detect correlations in the presence of categorical variables, where the Pearson correlation makes little sense. 
Here a notebook written for the course that uses mutual information to tackle this goal:

[3] About using categorical variables as input to a model, note the difference between ordinal and nominal (categorical) variables ( "https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/whatstat/what-is-the-difference-between-categorical-ordinal-and-interval-variables/" ). 
Ordinal variables can be often encoded as numbers, e.g. in a random forest model, (and this is the approach we had in the course), but not nominal variables. 
For nominal variables you can explore for example OneHotEncoding ( "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-one-hot-encoding/" ). 
Note that if you have nominal variables with a lot of categories, the number of your input features will explode, so check the number of categories that you have.

[4] In a clinical setting, we may find the following set-up:
- Time-to-event prediction problem (e.g. death of patient)
- Deal with censored data (e.g. the patient in the training
set survived (lucky him) and does not have a precise time of
event )
In this case one presentation used:

Weighting Method to Link the Serum Metabolome to Treatment
